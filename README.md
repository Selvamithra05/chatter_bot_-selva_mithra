# chatter_bot_-selva_mithra
This project is a simple Flask-based mental health chatbot that helps users manage stress and anxiety through conversation. It offers breathing, relaxation, and visualization exercises, along with motivational quotes. It is an educational tool and not a replacement for professional mental health care.
